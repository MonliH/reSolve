# reSolve

reSolve is a web application that uses deep learning to assist with creating and maintaining your New Year's resolutions. You input a few non-specific resolutions and reSolve will generate other similar resolutions to take on. Then, our deep learning algorithm plans specific next steps for each resolution, making it easier than ever to achieve your goal!
